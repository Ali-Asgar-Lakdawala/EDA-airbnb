# Airbnb Booking Analysis

This San-Francisco-based startup Airbnb offers you someone’s home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. Airbnb allows you to be a host for anyone anywhere with rooms/beds available in your personal space. In this EDA project, we were provided with a dataset of different listings (homes/apartments) in New York with names of the hosts, their geolocation, price, availability throughout the year, total, and per month rating.

The first step we performed was data-wrangling over the raw data by univariate analysis. Then we divided the project into different topics 

In most busy hosts we focused on the sum of reviews per month. We found that all of their listings were in key locations near the airport, tourist destinations, and in the lower part of Manhattan because it comprises the offices and headquarters of many city’s major financial institutions. We came to this conclusion by their geolocation, price, availability, and other description.

In most popular hosts we focused on No listing. We found that all the houses were in lower Manhattan or near Manhattan in Brooklyn. They probably focus on business rentals over-tourism rentals

For traffic distribution, we mapped geolocation of listings with price and density of listing; this helped us to find out where and why people like to stay at that location.

By various uni and multivariate analysis, we found out the ideal conditions of a host to gain max out of their listings. We also tried to test our intuitions in this EDA as in does price affects no of reviews and finds out what are the common words used for the name of apartments.
